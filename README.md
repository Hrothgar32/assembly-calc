Features
========

A simple base 10 calculator, capable of integer and floating point
arithmetic commands.

Implementation
==============

Stack
-----

As the calculator should be capable of evaluating a complex mathematical
expression, the straightforward way would be to use the stack, pushing
values to it.

Groups of three
---------------

As division and multiplication are prioritezed, I have to come up with a
solution for separating the operands into groups of three around these
prioritezed operations.
